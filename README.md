# Project: Bird Detection using Python and YOLOv8 

<h2>Description:</h2>
Developed a bird detection system using Python and YOLOv8, a powerful object detection model.

This project focused on:</br>
<strong> Automating bird detection in images and video:</strong> Identify the presence of birds in various visual formats with high accuracy.
<strong> Potential applications:</strong>  Provide a foundation for further development like species classification, population monitoring, or automated bird feeder activation.
</br><strong> Model Training:</strong>  Trained the YOLOv8 model on the prepared dataset, achieving an accuracy of 89% in bird detection.

<h4>Technical Skills:</h4>Python: Programming language used for project development.
</br>YOLOv8: Deep learning model for object detection.
